       <h1> Chinese Kungfu </h1>
           <p>Chinese Kung Fu (Martial Arts or as popularly referred to as
           Gongfu or Wushu) is a series of fighting styles which has developed over a 
           long historical period in China. Nowadays, it is regarded as a traditional sport
            gaining more and more popularity and even stands as a representative for Chinese culture.
             Styles including Shaolin, Tai Chi and Qigong have many followers worldwide. 
             Some westerners think that all Chinese people are Kung Fu masters. 
             That’s not true, but this traditional heritage has its unique existence in modern times and left much influence on the locals’ lifestyle.</p>
       <h2> History </h2>
       <p class=history> The genesis of Chinese martial arts has been attributed to the need for self-defense,
        hunting techniques and military training in ancient China. Hand-to-hand combat and weapons 
        practice were important in training ancient Chinese soldiers.[4][5]
        Detailed knowledge about the state and development of Chinese martial arts became available 
        from the Nanjing decade (1928–1937), as the Central Guoshu Institute established by the Kuomintang 
        regime made an effort to compile an encyclopedic survey of martial arts schools. Since the 1950s, 
        the People's Republic of China has organized Chinese martial arts as an exhibition and full-contact 
        sport under the heading of “wushu”.</p>
       <h3> Influence on Hip Hop</h3>
       <p class=Influence> In the 1970s, Bruce Lee was beginning to gain popularity in Hollywood for his martial arts movies.
       The fact that he was a non-white male who portrayed self-reliance and righteous self-discipline resonated 
       with black audiences and made him an important figure in this community.[77] Around 1973, Kung Fu movies 
       became a hit in America across all backgrounds; however, black audiences maintained the films’ popularity 
       well after the general public lost interest. Urban youth in New York City were still going from every borough 
       to Time Square every night to watch the latest movies.[78] Amongst these individuals were those coming
        from the Bronx where, during this time, hip-hop was beginning to take form. One of the pioneers responsible 
        for the development of the foundational aspects of hip-hop was DJ Kool Herc, who began creating this new 
        form of music by taking rhythmic breakdowns of songs and looping them. From the new music came a new form 
        of dance known as b-boying or breakdancing, a style of street dance consisting of improvised acrobatic moves. 
        The pioneers of this dance credit kung fu as one of its influences. Moves such as the crouching low leg sweep 
        and “up rocking” (standing combat moves) are influenced by choreographed kung-fu fights.[79] The dancers’ ability
         to improvise these moves led way to battles, which were dance competitions between two dancers or crews judged
          on their creativity, skills and musicality. In a documentary, Crazy Legs, a member of breakdancing group Rock 
          Steady Crew, described the breakdancing battle being like an old kung fu movie, “where the one kung fu master 
          says something along the lines of ‘hun your kung fu is good, but mine is better,’ then a fight erupts.” </p>
