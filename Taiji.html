    <h1 style="background-color:Dodgerblue;"> Tai chi </h1>
      <p class= contain style="background-color:white;"> Tai chi (Chinese: 太極; pinyin: Tàijí), 
    short for T'ai chi ch'üan or Tàijí quán (太極拳), is an internal
    Chinese martial art practiced for both its defense training, 
    its health benefits and meditation. The term taiji is a 
    Chinese cosmological concept that refers to the flux of yin and yang,
    and 'quan' means fist. So, etymologically, Taijiquan is a fist 
    system based on the dynamic relationship between polarities (Yin and Yang). 
    Though originally conceived as a martial art, it is also typically
    practiced for a variety of other personal reasons: competitive wrestling 
    in the format of pushing hands (tui shou), demonstration competitions and 
    achieving greater longevity. As a result, a multitude of training forms
    exist, both traditional and modern, which correspond to those aims with 
    differing emphasis. Some training forms of tai chi are especially known for 
    being practiced with relatively slow movements.</p>

    <h2 style="background-color:Dodgerblue;">Qigong versus tai chi</h2>
    <p style="background-color:white;"> Main article: Qigong
    Qigong involves coordinated movement, breath, and awareness used for health,
    meditation, and martial arts training. While many scholars and practitioners 
    consider tai chi to be a type of qigong,[24][25] the two are commonly distinguished as 
    separate but closely related practices, with qigong playing an important role in training 
    for tai chi, and with many tai chi movements performed as part of qigong practice. The focus 
    of qigong is typically more on health or meditation than martial applications. Internally the 
    main difference is the flow of qi. In qigong, the flow of qi is held at a gate point for a moment
    to aid the opening and cleansing of the channels.[clarification needed] In tai chi, the flow 
    of qi is continuous, thus allowing the development of power for the use by the practitioner.</p>
