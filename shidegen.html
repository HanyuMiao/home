   <h1> Shaolin Kungfu </h1>
    <p> Shaolin Kung Fu (Chinese: 少林功夫; pinyin: Shàolín gōng fu),
     also called Shaolin Wushu (少林武術; Shàolín wǔshù) or Shaolin quan (少林拳; Shàolín quán),
      is one of the oldest, largest, and most famous styles of wushu or kungfu. 
      It combines Ch'an philosophy and martial arts and originated and was developed in the Shaolin
       temple in Henan province, China during its 1500-year history. Popular sayings in Chinese 
       folklore related to this practice include "All martial arts under heaven originated from 
       Shaolin" and "Shaolin kung fu is the best under heaven," indicating the influence of Shaolin 
       kung fu among martial arts. The name Shaolin is also used as a brand for the so-called external 
       styles of kung fu. Many styles in southern and northern China use the name Shaolin.</p>
   <h2> Content</h2>
   <p> Shaolin temple has two main legacies: Chan (禅), which refers to Chan Buddhism, 
   the religion of Shaolin, and Quan (拳), which refers to the martial arts of Shaolin.
    In Shaolin, these are not separate disciplines and monks have always pursued the 
    philosophy of the unification of Chan and Quan (禅拳合一; chan quan he yi). In a deeper
     point of view, Quan is considered part of Chan. As late Shaolin monk Suxi said in the
      last moments of his life, "Shaolin is Chan, not Quan."</p>
