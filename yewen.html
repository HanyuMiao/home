     <h2> Teacher of Bruce Lee </h2>
     <p> Ip Man, also known as Yip Man,
         (Chinese: 葉問; 1 October 1893 – 2 December 1972) was a Chinese martial artist of Canton ancestry,
         and a master teacher of Wing Chun Kung Fu. He had several students who later became martial arts masters in their own right. 
         His most famous student was Bruce Lee.</p>

     <h1> Wing Chun (a kind of martial arts) </h1>
     <p> Wing Chun is a Chinese traditional martial art. 
     It is a technology to stop the invasion. It is a positive and streamlined legitimate defense system and a legal use of force.
     Compared with other traditional Chinese martial arts, it is more focused on subduing opponents 
     as soon as possible to minimize the damage of the parties.</p>
     <h2> Relaxation </h2>
     <p>Softness (via relaxation) and performance of techniques in a relaxed manner, 
     and by training the physical, mental, breathing, energy and force in a relaxed manner 
     to develop Chi "soft wholesome force",[7] is fundamental to Wing Chun. On "softness" in 
     Wing Chun, Yip Man during an interview said: Wing Chun is in some sense a "soft" school
      of martial arts. However, if one equates that work as weak or without strength, then they 
      are dead wrong. Chi Sau in Wing Chun is to maintain one's flexibility and softness, all 
      the while keeping in the strength to fight back, much like the flexible nature of bamboo".</p>
